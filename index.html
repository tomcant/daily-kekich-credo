    <p>Credo &#35;93</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The best investment you will ever make is your steady increase of knowledge. Invest in yourself. Thirty minutes of study per day eventually makes you an expert in any subject â€“ but only if you apply that knowledge. Study alone is no substitute for experience. Education is always painfully slow.</p>
