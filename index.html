    <p>Credo &#35;4</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Real regrets only come from not doing your best. All else is out of your control. You’re measured by results only. Trade excuses and "trying" for results, and expect half-hearted results from half-hearted efforts. Do more than is expected of you. Life’s easy when you live it the hard way… and hard if you try to live it the easy way.</p>
