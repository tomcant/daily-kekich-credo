    <p>Credo &#35;1</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>People will do almost anything to stay in their comfort zones. If you want to accomplish anything, get out of your comfort zone. Strive to increase order and discipline in your life. Discipline usually means doing the opposite of what you feel like doing. The easy roads to discipline are:<ol><li>Setting deadlines,</li><li>Discovering and doing what you do best and whatâ€™s important and enjoyable to you and</li><li>Focusing on habits by replacing your bad habits and thought patterns, one-by-one, over time, with good habits and thought patterns.</li></ol></p>
