    <p>Credo &#35;98</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The first rule of sharpening your mind is to be an alert and sensitive observer. Assume nothing. If it can’t be observed, it’s not true. Never act on blind faith. Whenever something sounds too good to be true, it almost always is. Refuse to be swayed by emotion when it conflicts with reason. Observation is the genesis of all knowledge and progress…and is the first and last step of every thinking man’s tool – The Scientific Method. All science and most progress is built on the Scientific Method (most non-scientists use it by accident). The steps are:<ol><li>OBSERVATION. Gathering and rationally organizing facts. This is where most people fail.</li><li>INDUCTIVE REASONING. Forming a hypothesis – or a generalization of facts held to be true.</li><li>EXTRAPOLATION. Making a projection or prediction based on the hypothesis in areas you didn’t yet observe.</li><li>OBSERVATION. A test for the hypothesis to see if it works.</li></ol></p>
